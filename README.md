# CLI Hangman

Welcome to Hangman! To start, just clone this in github. Once you're in the Hangman file, type ruby bin/hangman into the console and follow the commands! Good luck!

## Tentative Plan
 - Begin with asking someone if they want to play with 0, 1, or 2 players
 - One player guesses, one person picks new word
 - If player guess is right, add it to "board" (_ _ _ )
 - If player guess is wrong, show the hangman (have ASCII drawing?) Increase body parts every time they are wrong
 - Until player guesses word or has the whole body, keep doing this
  -When they have won/lost, ask if they want to play again

## Possible things to do in the future:
- tests?
- Refactor some more so there are less if/else statements

- AI for computer guesses? Any strategy for hangman?
- Add hint option
- Option to start with all vowels put in?
- For one player, someone can choose to guess or pick?
- Give easy/medium/hards from computer
